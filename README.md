# Seed Phrase Encrypter

## Project Summary

It's a tool designed to streamline the **encryption and decryption of a seed phrase**. A seed phrase is a set of words used to recover a crypto wallet. You typically receive this set of words when creating a wallet. </br>

The entire encryption or decryption process is performed **locally**, meaning no data is sent over or transmitted through the network. Your information is as secure as your system is, so make sure you're entering the information in a secure environment. </br>

## How it Works

The encryption/decryption process is simple, utilizing the **AES method through the 'crypto.js'** library version 4.2.0, which facilitates if the user wants to replicate the decryption process independently. </br>

## Notes
1 - The code isn't optimized, but currently, all functionalities are working correctly!</br>
